## Machine Learning Models

This repository is a collection of machine learning models which have been developed and trained using small datasets to provide examples of a varitey of machine learning techniques. This repository is a work in progress and is likely to be incoplete until additional models are added. 

The current plan of attack is to follow the curriculum devised by Dr. Jason Brownlee on the [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/practice-machine-learning-with-small-in-memory-datasets-from-the-uci-machine-learning-repository/) blog.
